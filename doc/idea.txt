I want to build a neovim package the allows inline ai edits. 

The flow for a user is:
- make a selection
- press a keybind to show a input field
- write what they want to happen
- the prompt is sent to an llm
- the change is made in place, no confirm etc

The strcture should be that the main pacakge is written in lua and  the ai portion is written in typescript using the vercel ai sdk. To start it will use morphllm

```
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.MORPH_API_KEY,
  baseURL: "https://api.morphllm.com/v1",
});

const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: "morph-v3-large",
  messages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: `<instruction>${instructions}</instruction>\n<code>${initialCode}</code>\n<update>${codeEdit}</update>`,
    },
  ],
});

const mergedCode = response.choices[0].message.content;
```

The package will have a system prompt but should be overwidable in the set up of the package.
